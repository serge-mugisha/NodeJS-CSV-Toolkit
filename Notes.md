## Instructions
- Create a record object (also known as entity object, data-transfer object) that uses the column
  names from the dataset as part of the source code, e.g. variable names, accessors/mutators names, or constants.

- Use File-IO on startup to open and read the dataset
- Initializing a few record objects with data parsed from the first few records in the csv file.
- The record objects should be stored in a simple data structure (array or a list)
- Use exception handling in case the file is missing or not available.

- Loop over the data structure, and output the record data on screen
- Displays your full name on screen so it remains visible at all times.

- Use JSDoc to document your code

### Progeamming Concepts

- variables
- methods
- loop structure
- FileIO reading from the dataset
- exception handling
- use of an API library
- an array (simiral data structure)
